                        <!-- <p>Hallo! I'm Sergiu-Octavian and I love creating stuff, of course. I'm the guy that is called by my artist friends "programmer" and by my developer friends "artist". I have a background in design, but I love to take part also into the development of <strong>my designs</strong> and to experiment with new technologies. It is hard for me to choose between art&tech because both are part of my life, that's why designing for web is the best way to "exploit" the shit out of my mind. :) If I stuble upon a problem (technical or non-technical) I will most likely find the solution by myself because I never said that "it can't be done". There is always a solution, it just have to be approached on the right angle.</p>
                        <p>I have a big ego, but paradoxically I know how to be humble and reasonable because <em>design</em> is about team work, not personal expression. For me, our project is the most important thing and I will always strive to bring new ideas and elevate the level of thinking in order to create the best outcome possible.  I believe there is too much junk in the world and my goal is to create togeder with you high quality digital experiences that have a real impact on people. Clients with a desire to be preeminent and rebellious against the status quo are a great source of inspiration for me. Most of the time I've worked with startups or individuals that are into creative, cultural or environmental fields, but I am always up for a new challenge!</p>
                        <p>If you just need a hand to click for you, this is not the right place. I don't do this just for money and I value my work&time.</p>
                        <p>P.S. Sometimes if there is a topic with no budget for design that catches my soul and I have time, I do pro-bono work. I think it is important to support eachother in creating a better life, not thinking only about making profit.</p> -->
                        <p>I design, develop, create and love.</p>
                        <p>If you feel that we are a good match,</p>

                        <p>Why the name "vibrant matter"?</p>
                        <p>Everything looks still into our eyes, but the world is vibrating. All material things are vibrating at us in this moment and we are vibrating back at them. The micro and macro cosmos are actually the same and we are all part of it.</p>
                        <p>The creative process can be defined as the action of deconstructing something in order to reconstruct it in a different way. In this process, new vibratons are created and once we recognize that all matter is actually vibrating energy, we can begin to form a new vision for the world, ethics and interaction.</p>
