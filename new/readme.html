                        <p>Born & raised in the heart of Transylvania, I was genuinely influenced by the multicultural environment noted by german and hungarian historical accents. As a professional, with over 4 years of experience, I got involved in a variety of projects with companies or individuals. In the work process, I always strive to bring new ideas and elevate the level of thinking in a synergy that can be very productive in creating the best outcome. Clients with a desire to be preeminent and rebellious against the status quo are a great source of inspiration for me and I am always committed to their project. Most of the time I work with startups or individuals that are into creative, cultural or environmental fields, but I am always up for a new challenge!</p>

                        <p>Everything looks still into our eyes, but the world is vibrating. All material things are vibrating at us in this moment and we are vibrating at them.</p>
                        <p>The creative process can be defined as the action of deconstructing something in order to reconstruct it in a different way. In this process, new vibratons are created and once we recognize that all matter is actually vibrating energy, we can begin to form a new vision for the world, ethics and interaction.</p>
