                            <h2>My name is Sergiu-Octavian. I'm a Designer with an excitement for coding. I'm focusing on building high-end, nonconformist yet usable digital designs for bold customers like you. </h2>

                            <h2>I taught myself front end because I like to get involved into the building process of digital products and experiences, but I don't limit myself just to that, being excited about everything tech. Monotony is evil, that's why from time to time, non-digital projects are the missing key to the creative flow, so don't hesitate to tell me about yours! </h2>

                            <h2>For me, our project is the most important thing and I will always strive to bring new ideas and elevate the level of thinking in order to create the best outcome possible. </h2>

                            <h2>I have been designing for web&print for over 4 years within start-ups or with individuals that are into creative, cultural or environmental fields and I am always up to approach a new challenge. </h2>

                            <h3>Aesthetics phylosophy</h3>
                            <p>I like to experiment a lot and I always strive to keep an open mind. Usually I manipulate shades of black and white, using color accents only to highlight important elements or for branding purposes. Content is king and the experience is queen. I believe simple is not only functional, but beautiful. In the same time, I love the really clever small details that make the difference.</p>
                            
                            <h3>I do: </h3>
                            <p>UX, UI, interaction, print, branding, simple 2D animation, simple 3D models</p>

                            <h3>I use:</h3>
                            <p> Adobe Creative Cloud, Sketch, Sublime, Git, Rhinno, Keyshot</p>
                            <p>html5, css3, SASS, jQuery, ionic/angular</p>

                            <h3>Why vibrant matter?</h3>

                            <p>Everything looks still into our eyes, but the world is vibrating. All material things are vibrating at us in this moment and we are vibrating back at them. The micro and macro cosmos are actually the same and we are all part of it.</p>
                            <p>The creative process can be defined as the action of deconstructing something in order to reconstruct it in a different way. In this process, new vibratons are created and once we recognize that all matter is actually vibrating energy, we can begin to form a new vision for the world, ethics and interaction.</p>
