              <h2>Product highlights</h2>
              <p>The product is based on a <strong>win-win approach</strong>, helping students to save pocket money by providing them with good <strong>deals</strong> at certain locations. This brings more people to venues, creating a constant and <strong>controlled flow of customers</strong> during all open hours by using AI integrated POS Systems with the goal of incresing the profit.</p>
              <br><br><br>
              <h2>Challenges</h2>
              <p>First, students have a very well developed social behavior but not always enough money for it.
Secondly, during the open hours, there are time frames when venues are overcrowded with customers and the so-called "dead hours" periods. The challenge was to regulate the flow of customers by attracting students using limited time offers during the time when the location is empty.</p>
              <h2>Goals</h2>
              <p>The goal was to help business owners have more control over the flow of customers, increasing their profit by helping students enjoy their social life on a budget.</p>

              <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.3);">The solution was in the form of a mobile app that will display the limited time offers to the students automatically based on the free tables available in the venue. The MVP is based on 3 main features as a core experience.</p>
