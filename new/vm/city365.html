              <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.3);">The concept is based on 4 main attributes: friendly, exciting, youthful, cheap. Psychology of color consists in neutral tones with strong exciting highlights based on the Coca-Cola/McDonalds prooven model as an subliminal incentive for the users to take action and take the offers. The phylosophy behind the predominant round and bulky shape style gives the app a very approachable and friendly feeling.</p>
